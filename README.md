# Terrorism Trends and Economic Influence in Egypt

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project examining the relationship between terrorism incidents and economic factors in Egypt, with a particular focus on inflation rates. The analysis spans multiple decades and investigates various hypotheses about how economic conditions may influence terrorism patterns in the country.

## Key Research Questions
1. Is there a significant relationship between inflation rates and terrorism incidents in Egypt?
2. Did the 2011 Arab Spring events significantly impact terrorism patterns in Egypt?
3. Are there regional differences in terrorism incidents across Egyptian provinces?
4. Can economic indicators help predict future terrorism trends in Egypt?

## Dataset
The primary dataset (`Egypt_terr_augmented_with_infilation.csv`) contains:
- 2,478 terrorism incidents in Egypt
- 46 data columns including dates, locations, attack types, casualties, and more
- Augmented with annual inflation data for economic analysis

## Analysis Methods
This project employs various statistical and data science techniques:
- Time series analysis of terrorism incidents
- Negative binomial regression modeling
- Mann-Kendall trend analysis
- Regional clustering and geospatial analysis
- Hypothesis testing for causal relationships
